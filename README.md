# Colton Allen's mock Bakery Website

For 12 years I owned and operated a Custom Cake Bakery in Riverside, CA, so I thought it only fitting for my first solo project to be an online shop for baked goods. It was a fun project and I learned a lot through it.

## Technologies used:

#### • HTML5
#### • CSS
#### • JavaScript (vanilla)

Utilizing MVC architecture helped keep me on task and organized with my code and I am happy with the results. I intend to improve this eshop in the future with much more functionality, as well.
